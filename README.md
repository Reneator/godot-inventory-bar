# godot-inventory-bar
Just a quick project i created to help someone on discord

Made in godot 3.2.2beta2

This project tries to implement a small and specific version of a progressbar with slots, to which items get added. This project is to demonstrate/show the way i would currently do it, by using scenes, resources, singleton signals etc.

You can just download the project, open it and run it, to see it in action.
